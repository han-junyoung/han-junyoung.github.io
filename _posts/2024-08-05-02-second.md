Tips for programming using C++. 

# Vector

Vector are the most essential to the c++ language. The array is inefficient if insertion and deletion occur frequently. But vector is dynamically allocated tools, they can be efficiently used for algorithms where insertion and deletion occur frequently.

## Useing vector

1. Code

    ```c++
   #include<vector>
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    vector<int> v={1,2,3}
    }
    ```
    at vector v data 1,2,3 is stored. 

2. Usefull Vector function

    ```c++
    #include<vector>
    using namespace std;
    int main()
    {
    v.push_back();
    v.pop_back();
    v.insert(iterator position, const value_type& val);
    v[idx];// refer to [idx] element
    v.clear();
    }
    ```
    v.push_back() function add a value to the last part of the vector. v.pop_back() is similar with push_back() function but it add a value to the first part of the vector. v.insert() function insert val at position. v[idx] refer to [idx] element. This is more faster then v.at(idx) function. v.clear() funcion clear value at vector v. 

    
3. What kind of problems do vector have?

    ```c++
    #include <iostream>
    #include <vector>

    using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
    vector<int> v;
    int n;
    cout << "Enter the number of elements: ";
    cin >> n;
    cout << "Enter " << n << " integers:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        int temp;
        cin >> temp;
        v.push_back(temp);
    }
    cout << "The elements in the vector are:" << endl;
    for (const auto& elem : v) {
        cout << elem << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
    }
    ```
    
	If you try to execute this code, you receive n to generate n vectors, store n data in the vector, and output it. This vector is int type vector so you can only save int type data. If you want to save not an int type data you can't use vector v. This is problem of vector. So can vectors only be used if they only store the same kind of data type?
	
# Template

1. What is Template?

We learn about vector. If you declare <int> type vector v you can input <int> type data at vector v. When we want to input <string> type data c++ support it under name template.(template는 어떤 물건을 찍어내는 틀과 같다.) If we use template then we can solve the problem of vector that described above.

  ```c++
  #include<iostream>
  #include<string>

  template<typename T>
  class Vector{
  T* data
  }
  ```

If you want to input <int> type then it will save int type, if you want to input <string> type it will save string type.
