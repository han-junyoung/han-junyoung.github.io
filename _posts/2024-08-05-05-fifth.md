# Unsupervised learning
The machine learning model for Unstructured data is an unsupervised learning model. It is a model that learns something in the data without being specified by a human. For example, it is a model that learns 100 fruit photo models, looks at new photos, and finds out what kind of fruit it is.

## What is unsupervised learning
The unsupervised learning model first analyzes pixel values by dividing pictures into pixels. For example, it is a method of dividing a picture into 100*100 pixels and analyzing one pixel. When data is expressed in a two-dimensional arrangement, 100 pixel values in width and 100 data in length are expressed. The average of the horizontal values is the average of data for one data, and the vertical is the average of the entire data.
After expressing this, similar samples can be collected!

## Code(python)
I will show code with furit data(apple,pineapple,banna).
We must download furit's image with this code.
```python
!wget https://bit.ly/fruits_300_data -O fruits_300.npy
```
From the code we can check how unsupervised machine-learning model works.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fruits = np.load('fruits_300.npy')
print(fruits.shape)
print(fruits[0, 0, :])
plt.imshow(fruits[0], cmap='gray')
plt.show()
plt.imshow(fruits[0], cmap='gray_r')
plt.show()
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)
axs[0].imshow(fruits[100], cmap='gray_r')
axs[1].imshow(fruits[200], cmap='gray_r')
plt.show()
apple = fruits[0:100].reshape(-1, 100*100)
pineapple = fruits[100:200].reshape(-1, 100*100)
banana = fruits[200:300].reshape(-1, 100*100)
print(apple.shape)
print(apple.mean(axis=1))

plt.hist(np.mean(apple, axis=1), alpha=0.8)
plt.hist(np.mean(pineapple, axis=1), alpha=0.8)
plt.hist(np.mean(banana, axis=1), alpha=0.8)
plt.legend(['apple', 'pineapple', 'banana'])
plt.show()

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(20, 5))
axs[0].bar(range(10000), np.mean(apple, axis=0))
axs[1].bar(range(10000), np.mean(pineapple, axis=0))
axs[2].bar(range(10000), np.mean(banana, axis=0))
plt.show()

apple_mean = np.mean(apple, axis=0).reshape(100, 100)
pineapple_mean = np.mean(pineapple, axis=0).reshape(100, 100)
banana_mean = np.mean(banana, axis=0).reshape(100, 100)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(20, 5))
axs[0].imshow(apple_mean, cmap='gray_r')
axs[1].imshow(pineapple_mean, cmap='gray_r')
axs[2].imshow(banana_mean, cmap='gray_r')
plt.show()


abs_diff = np.abs(fruits - apple_mean)
abs_mean = np.mean(abs_diff, axis=(1,2))
print(abs_mean.shape)

apple_index = np.argsort(abs_mean)[:100]
fig, axs = plt.subplots(10, 10, figsize=(10,10))
for i in range(10):
    for j in range(10):
        axs[i, j].imshow(fruits[apple_index[i*10 + j]], cmap='gray_r')
        axs[i, j].axis('off')
plt.show()
```
